# HadoopShortestPath
This the program to compute the a shortest path using Djiskra's algorithm.

On very iteration, mapper will compute the links between all the nodes and reducer will compute the shortest path to the exposed nodes.
This process will carried untill all the nodes are computed with the shortest path.

Thankyou.
